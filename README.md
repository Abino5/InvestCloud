# InvestCloud
InvestCloud is a test application developed to retrieve 1000 x 1000 datasets from a web service, and perform matrix multiplication and validation of MD5 hash generated by the resulting 2d matrix.

Built in .NET 7, this tiny application performs extensive computing operations to ensure the task is completed within the shortest possible time (30 secs).
The objective was achieved by ensuring codes are re-used, loops are minimized as much as possible, and concurrent tasks are run for executions that do not depend on eachother.
